This machine learning model classifies sonar signals to distinguish between mines and rocks on the seabed.
It uses a supervised learning approach, trained on the Sonar dataset, where each instance is represented by 60 features extracted from sonar signal returns. 
The model was built using standard preprocessing techniques and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. After tuning,
the best-performing classifier achieved high accuracy in correctly identifying dangerous mines versus harmless rocks, making it useful for underwater object detection applications.
